## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
kable(anova(fit))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, dpi=400, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
par(mar=c(5,5,2,2))
palette(rainbow(3))
with(mtcars,plot(hp, mpg, pch=21, 
                 xlab="Horse power",
                 ylab="Miles per gallon",
                 bg=as.factor(gear), cex=1.2))
legend("topright", levels(as.factor(mtcars$gear)), pch=21, pt.bg=palette(),
       title="Gears")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
